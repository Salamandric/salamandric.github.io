<h2>Note to Playtesters</h2>
<p><b>Mechanic Prefixes:</b> Cards in the playtest will have usually names that generally describe the card, with two-letter prefixes if the card is design for a particular set mechanics. They are the following:<br>
<ul style=text-align:left;>
<li>FT = Foretell</li>
<li>HL = Home land</li>
<li>TR = Take a risk</li>
<li>TS = Tribute summon</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Design Codes:</b> Cards in the playtest will have design codes on them that are the first part of the card's name. These codes look like "UR04", and are mainly for the design side, but if you want to know what they mean I'll describe it here. The first character displays rarity, the second card color/type, and then its index.</p>
<p>So a card with the name "UW04 TR AEDestroy" would be the fourth uncommon white card in the set, with an effect involving taking a risk, and destroying artifacts and/or enchantments.</p>

<h1>Set Mechanics</h1>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are a number of mechanics appearing in the unofficial Yu-Gi-Oh! x Magic the Gathering set. Some new and a couple returning mechanics, so lets look into them.</p>

<h2>Fields</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">These new lands have a new type to them: Field. These lands are made out of KaibaCorp's patented solid vision technology fine-tuned to create a landscape so realistic you can even draw mana from them!</p>

<h2>Foretell</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Foretell makes its comeback! If you have a card with foretell in your hand, you can pay <i class="mana mana-cost mana-2"></i> to hide it away in exile face-down and cast it later for it's foretell cost.</p>
<img src="/sets/YGO-files/img/70_CU14 FT Draw2 then fly.jpg" alt="Foretell card">
<p>CU14 is usually cast for <i class="mana mana-cost mana-3"></i><i class="mana mana-cost mana-u"></i>, but if you spend <i class="mana mana-cost mana-2"></i> and hide it away until the next turn, you can cast it for only <i class="mana mana-cost mana-1"></i><i class="mana mana-cost mana-u"></i>.</p>
<!--Add card with foretell benefit-->

<h2>Home land</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">These spells are nice, but they get even better when used on their home turf. These cards will have special abilities that only work if you have three lands that it recognizes as its home (usually the basic land type that produces it's color).</p>
<img src="/sets/YGO-files/img/176_CG06 HL Enter fight.jpg" alt="Home land card">
<p>CG06 is a pretty standard creature, but if it arrives in its home, the forest, it can immediately pounce on another player's creature.</p>

<h2>Take a risk</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Wanna bet it all on red? Think you have what it takes to not go minus one? Then taking a risk is great for you! When a card says to take a risk, you discard a card from your hand, and look at the top card of your deck. If the top card happens to share a card type with the card you discarded, you can show off how your risk paid off and add it to your hand. Although you could say that either way you're winning, because cards have bonuses if you take a risk regardless of whether it paid off or not.</p>
<img src="/sets/YGO-files/img/142_CR10 TR Sparksy.jpg" alt="Risk card">
<p>With TR Sparksy, you can take a risk to deal an extra point of damage, regardless of if you got another card.</p>
<!-- ##Add a card later with a risk that needs to pay off -->

<h2>Tribute summon</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">With tribute summoning, you can cast big creatures for a steeper mana cost, at the price of creatures you control. The creatures you sacrifice need to be untapped and have power 2 or more in order to be worthy sacrifices for such creatures, but each one sacrificed will pay for an amount of mana stated by the card. You can even use a card's tribute summon ability to pay for its foretell cost!</p>
<img src="/sets/YGO-files/img/103_CB09 TS FVanilla Fly Tramp.jpg" alt="Tribute summon card">
<p>CB09 usually costs <i class="mana mana-cost mana-6"></i><i class="mana mana-cost mana-b"></i>, but if you sacrifice a creature you can cast it for only <i class="mana mana-cost mana-3"></i><i class="mana mana-cost mana-b"></i>. Even further, if you sacrifice two creatures you could cast it for only <i class="mana mana-cost mana-b"></i>!</p>
