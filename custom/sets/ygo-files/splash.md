<h1>Set Mechanics</h1>
<p>There are a number of mechanics appearing in the unofficial Yu-Gi-Oh! x Magic the Gathering set. Some new and a couple returning mechanics, so lets look into them.</p>

<h2>Foretell</h2>
<p>Foretell makes its comeback! If you have a card with foretell in your hand, you can pay <i class="mana mana-2"></i> to hide it away in exile face-down and cast it later for it's foretell cast.</p>

<h2>Take a risk</h2>
<p>Wanna bet it all on red? Think you have what it takes to not go minus one? Then taking a risk is great for you! When a card says to take a risk, you discard a card from your hand, and look at the top card of your deck. If the top card happens to share a card type with the card you discarded, you can show off how your risk paid off and add it to your hand. Although you could say that either way you're winning, because some cards have bonuses if you take a risk regardless of whether it paid off or not.</p>

<h2>Tribute summon</h2>
<p>With tribute summoning, you can cast big creatures for a steeper mana cost, at the price of creatures you control. The creatures you sacrifice need to be untapped and have power 2 or more in order to be worthy sacrifices for such creatures, but each one sacrificed will pay for an amount of mana stated by the card. You can even use a card's tribute summon ability to pay for its foretell cost!</p>

<h2>Home land</h2>
<p>These spells are nice, but they get even better when used on their home turf. These cards will have special abilities that only work if you have three lands that it recognizes as its home.</p>
